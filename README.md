Goals: 
    1. Create a basic budgeting tool for users to track vacation expenses. 
    2. Provide easy-to-use input fields for users to enter their estimated costs for flights, hotels, food, and activities. 
    3. Allow users to set a total budget and see how much they are spending. 
    4. Show remaining budget in real-time, helping users adjust plans. 
    5. Offer simple suggestions to save money, like choosing a different flight or hotel. 

Outcome: 
    1. Built a basic budget calculator where users enter their expenses. 
    2. Added a total budget tracker to compare planned vs. actual spending. 
    3. Implemented a simple cost breakdown table for clarity. 
    4. Faced with challenges with frequent price changes, so the tool allows manual updates.
